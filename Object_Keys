// A program to print the marks of a student in an object using for loop
let marks ={
  sayeed: 90,
  kasheef: 100
}
for(let i =0;i<Object.keys(marks).length;i++){ //we are attainig the length of the object
  console.log("The marks of " + Object.keys(marks)[i] + " are "+ marks[Object.keys(marks)[i]])
}

    Object.Keys(marks)[i]
    The above line of code get the key of marks(object) according to its indexing position

    marks[Object.Keys(marks)[i]]
    The above line of code get the value of the corresponding key 

ouput: The marks of sayeed are 90;


//using for in loop

for( let i in marks){       //here i is just a variable
 console.log("The marks of" + i + " are " + marks[i])
}
