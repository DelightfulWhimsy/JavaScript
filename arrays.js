// Array methods

const n = [1,2,3,]
n.toString();  // toString() used to convert the array elements into strings
console.log(n)

//expected ouput: 1,2,3, which has become a string

let n1=[74,5,6]
n1.join("and")
console.log(n1)


//expected output: 74 and 5 and 6
//join() joins the array elements with the provided arguments in it.

 const rm = [1,2,3,4]
 rm.pop()  //removes the last element from the array
let m = rm.pop()
 console.log(rm , m)
//pop returns the poped element
 
 
 //expected output: [1,2,3,]
